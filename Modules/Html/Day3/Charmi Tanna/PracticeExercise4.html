            NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday asked the Centre what it has learnt from the Nizamuddin Markaz congregation earlier this year
            amid Covid-19, and the same situation may arise with the protesting farmers, if precautionary measures are not taken to contain the
            spread of Covid-19.

            Citing the ongoing farmers protest at various Delhi borders, a bench headed by Chief Justice S.A. Bobde asked the Solicitor General
            Tushar Mehta, "You must tell us what is happening?"
        </p>
        <p>
            The bench also comprising Justices A.S. Bopanna and V. Ramasubramanian queried further, whether farmers protesting at various Delhi borders
            are taking precaution to contain the spread of Covid-19.

            When the Solicitor General replied in negative, the top court said it could potentially become a situation like the Nizamuddin Markaz congregation in the national capital, which happened in March last year. Mehta replied that he will find the status.
