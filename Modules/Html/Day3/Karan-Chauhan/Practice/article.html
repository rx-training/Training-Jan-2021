            The main function of a leaf is to produce food for the plant by photosynthesis. 
            Chlorophyll, the substance that gives plants their characteristic green colour, 
            absorbs light energy. The internal structure of the leaf is protected by the leaf epidermis,
            which is continuous with the stem epidermis. The central leaf, or mesophyll, consists of soft-walled,
            unspecialized cells of the type known as parenchyma. As much as one-fifth of the mesophyll is
            composed of chlorophyll-containing chloroplasts, which absorb sunlight and, in conjunction with 
            certain enzymes, use the radiant energy in decomposing water into its elements, 
            hydrogen and oxygen.

                The oxygen liberated from green leaves replaces the oxygen removed from the atmosphere by plant 
                and animal respiration and by combustion. The hydrogen obtained from water is combined with 
                carbon dioxide in the enzymatic processes of photosynthesis to form the sugars that are the basis
                of both plant and animal life. Oxygen is passed into the atmosphere through stomata�pores in the 
                leaf surface.
