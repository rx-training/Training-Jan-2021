Let defines the variable locally and if we have global variable with the same name, it won't be affected if we change local variable defined using 'let'.

For example:

var num = 100;

function demo(){{'{'}}
    let num = 50; // it's scope is only local
{{'}'}}

console.log(num); // it will print 100 as we have defined globally, let keyword won't affect outside it's scope.
