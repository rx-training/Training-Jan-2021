                HTML is the language in which most websites are written. HTML is used to create pages and make them functional.HTML was 
                first created by Tim Berners-Lee, Robert Cailliau, and others starting in 1989. It stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.
                Hypertext means that the document contains links that allow the reader to jump to other places in the document or to 
                another document altogether. The latest version is known as HTML5. A Markup Language is a way that computers speak to 
                each other to control how text is processed and presented. To do this HTML uses two things: tags and attributes.

                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML 
                or XML. CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media. CSS is among 
                the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers.CSS also has rules for alternate formatting 
                if the content is accessed on a mobile device.

                JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions.
                While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as 
                Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. It is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic 
                language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.
