            Sport includes all forms of competitive physical activity or games which,through casual or organized participation, 
            at least in part aim to use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants, and 
            in some cases, entertainment for spectators

            Sports can bring positive results to one's physical health. Hundreds of sports 
            exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams 
            or competing as individuals. In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, simultaneously or consecutively,
            with one  winner; in others, the contest (a match) is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other.

        <h4>
            Some sports allow a "tie" or "draw", in which there is no single winner;others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one 
            winner and one loser. A number of contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion. Many sports leagues make an
            annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs.
