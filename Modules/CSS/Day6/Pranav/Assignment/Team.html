            Sportskeeda was founded by its current Chief Executive Officer Porush Jain in association with his fellow sports enthusiasts
            Anshu Prasad and Robin Chhabria as well as Srinivas Cuddapah.<br><br>
            
            Name "SportsKeeda" is derived from a colloquial Hindi term that is the sporting equivalent of the word ‘bookworm’; 
            which translates to ‘sports worm’ in  English.<br><br>
            
            The website was initially run from the office of Jain’s father in Noida, but moved its operations to Bangalore in 
            011. Sportskeeda was backed by venture capital funding in its initial years. Seedfund, an organization that funds early-stage
            ventures, had invested Rs. 2.8 crore into Sportskeeda in 2011.<br><br>

            We are described as "the largest all-sports website in India, reporting on more than 30 different sports". The site 
            covers mainstream sports like football, cricket, tennis, basketball, hockey, Formula 1, badminton, wrestling and boxing, 
            as well as niche ones like kabaddi, squash, etc.<br><br>
