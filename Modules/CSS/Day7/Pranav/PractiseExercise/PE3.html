            Android is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source software, 
                designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Android is developed by a consortium 
                of developers known as the Open Handset Alliance and commercially sponsored by Google. <br><br>
                It was unveiled in November 2007, with the first commercial Android device launched in September 2008.It is free and 
                open source software; its source code is known as Android Open Source Project (AOSP), which is primarily licensed under 
                the Apache License. However most Android devices ship with additional proprietary software pre-installed, most notably 
                Google Mobile Services (GMS)[11] which includes core apps such as Google Chrome, the digital distribution platform Google Play and associated Google Play Services 
                development platform.<br><br> 
                About 70 percent of Android smartphones run Google's ecosystem; competing Android ecosystems and forks include Fire OS 
                (developed by Amazon) or LineageOS. However the "Android" name and logo are trademarks of Google which impose standards 
                to restrict "uncertified" devices outside their ecosystem to use Android branding.
