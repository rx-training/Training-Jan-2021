            A paragraph is a group of words put together to form a group that is usually longer than a sentence.
            Paragraphs are often made up of several sentences. There are usually between three and eight sentences.
            Paragraphs can begin with an indentation (about five spaces), or by missing a line out, and then starting again.
            This makes it easier to see when one paragraph ends and another begins.

            In most organized forms of writing, such as essays, paragraphs contain a topic sentence . 
            This topic sentence of the paragraph tells the reader what the paragraph will be about. 
            Essays usually have multiple paragraphs that make claims to support a thesis statement, which is the central idea of the essay.
