            Android is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source software, 
            designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Android is developed by a consortium of 
            developers known as the Open Handset Alliance and commercially sponsored by Google. It was unveiled in November 2007, with 
            the first commercial Android device launched in September 2008.It is free and open source software; its source code is known
            as Android Open Source Project (AOSP), which is primarily licensed under the Apache License. However most Android devices 
            ship with additional proprietary software pre-installed,[10] most notably Google Mobile Services (GMS)[11] which includes 
            core apps such as Google Chrome, the digital distribution platform Google Play and associated Google Play Services 
            development platform. About 70 percent of Android smartphones run Google's ecosystem; competing Android ecosystems and 
            forks include Fire OS (developed by Amazon) or LineageOS. However the "Android" name and logo are trademarks of Google which
            impose standards to restrict "uncertified" devices outside their ecosystem to use Android branding
