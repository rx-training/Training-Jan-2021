        Market cap of cryptocurrencies surpasses $1 trillion, bitcoin jumps 9%
        to trade above $37k
      </h2>
      <p>
        Cryptocurrencies are rising and how. The total value of the
        cryptocurrencies passed the $1-trillion mark for the first time on
        January 7. Bitcoin, which represents about 69 percent of the total
        market, rose over 9 percent, surpassing the $37,000-mark for the first
        time. Interest in cryptocurrencies has soared recently, with investors
        viewing them as a hedge against inflation and an alternative to the
        depreciating dollar.
