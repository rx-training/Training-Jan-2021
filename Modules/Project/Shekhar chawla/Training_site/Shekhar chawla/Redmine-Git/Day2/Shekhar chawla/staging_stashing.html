<body>
<p> adding file to stage </p>
<p> stashing </p>

<p> staging -> "git add file_name" adding that current file only to be commited </p>
<p> stashing -> "git stash file_name" if we want to shift our working to another, then we stash a file so that our working tree becomes cleanrtey.
 Also,It takes any uncommitted changes youâ€™ve made in your working directory and saves them away in something sort of like a branch, called refs/stash. It then reverts your working tree to HEAD.</p>
