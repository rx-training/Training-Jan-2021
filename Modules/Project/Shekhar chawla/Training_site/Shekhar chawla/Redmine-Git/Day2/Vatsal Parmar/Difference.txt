Difference between fetch and pull:
git fetch is used to get updated changes from the remote repository and 
git pull is used to copy those changes from the remote repository to local repository.

Difference between Stage and stash:
Stash will move modified files into a stack, so later in the same or another branch, you will be able to bring 
them back.
The Stage is the step before making a commit, we add modified files to the staging area to create
the next commit.
