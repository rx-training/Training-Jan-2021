Difference between stage the changes and stash the changes
Stage the changes-	Stage is the step before to make a commit, you add modified files to "Staged files" to create your next commit.
Stash the changes-	Stash will move your modified files into a stack. So, later in the same or in another branch, you will be able to bring them back and see those modifications in your project.
